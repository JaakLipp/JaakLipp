# To whom it may concern

### My name is Jackson and I am a Software Engineering Student at McMaster University

- I am currently working at EllisDon, a construction giant in Canada creating better ways to manage projects through software
- This profile will serve as my love letter to programming, as I have many exciting projects and ideas that will come to fruition
- If you're looking for someone to chat about software, or just chat in general, feel free to reach out to me
